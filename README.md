3. Describe Coffee Script?
   CoffeeScript is a little programming language that compiles into JavaScript. It is an attempt to exhibit the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way. It also assists to write JavaScript code better by presenting you with a more constant syntax and skirting the unusual nature of JavaScript language.
4. Explain what is clear?
   A clear is utilized when you don’t need an element to wrap around another element, such as a float.
5. Can you tell us when would you utilize CSS float?
   Float is utilized when you need to make an element of your web page be pushed to the right or left and make other elements cover around it.
6. What is a callback function?
   A callback function is utilized to limit this from happening because it is not called until the previous line of code has thoroughly executed.
7. How do you structure your source code to make it easy for leverage by your colleagues?
   A front-end developer needs to discuss their use of code organization and commenting. They need to explain how they use notes in their programming process to explain the steps they have taken, ensuring an efficiency of understanding amongst collaborators.
8. Explain what is the difference between Class and Prototypal inheritance?
   Inheritance in JavaScript is different from most other programming languages. The object system in JavaScript is prototype based, not class based. Objects in JavaScript are just a collection of a name (key) and value pairs. When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Every object has a private property which contains a link to another object called its prototype.
9. Can you explain the difference between visibility:hidden; and display:none?
   Visibility:Hidden; – It is not visible but gets up it’s original space.
   Display:None; – It is hidden and takes no space.
10. Explain what is the difference between a host object and a native object?
    Host Objects  – are objects supplied by a particular environment.
    Native Objects – are standard built-in objects given by Javascript.
11. What is the difference between XHTML and HTML?
    HTML and XHTML are both markup languages in which web pages are written. The main difference between the two is that HTML syntax is SGML based while XHTML syntax is XML based.
12. Explain how variables differ in CoffeeScript than JavaScript?
    In JavaScript, you have to add a semi-colon for variables at the end of it to execute. In CoffeeScript, there is no necessity to add Semi-colon at the end of the statement. Unlike, CoffeeScript, JavaScript adds up semi-colon with ease.
13. Can you tell us what are the benefits of Coffee Script over JavaScript?
    ◦ CoffeeScript has a lot of lightweight add-ons like Ruby string Interpolation and Python style list comprehension.
    ◦ It also enables you to express your program with a lot shorter code than JavaScript
    ◦ It makes even good JavaScript code more readable.
    • It makes everyday tasks easier to perform with CoffeeScript rather than JavaScript.
14. Explain what are the difference between Get and Post?
    A GET request is generally used for things like AJAX calls to an API, whereas a POST request is typically utilized to store data in a database or submit data through a form.
    GET requests are limited secure and can be viewed by the user in the URL, whereas POST requests are used in two steps and are not seen by the user. So, POST requests are more secure.
15. Can you tell us when would you utilize CSS clear?
    When I want an element on the left or right of the floating element not to wrap around it, I can utilize clear.
16. Describe what is the difference between Null and Undefined?
    Null is an object with no value.
    Undefined is a type.
    typeof null; // “object”
    typeof undefined; // “undefined”
17. Explain the importance of the HTML DOCTYPE?
    DOCTYPE is an instruction to the web browser regarding what version of the markup language the page is written. The DOCTYPE declaration need to be the pretty first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag. Doctype declaration points to a Document Type Definition (DTD). It provides markup language rules, so a browser can interpret the content correctly.
18. Explain the difference between cookies, session storage, and local storage?
    Cookies allow applications to store data in a client’s browser.
    Session storage property allows applications to store data until the window is closed.
    Local storage property lets applications to store data without an end.
19. Describe what is a Thread-Local object in Python Flask?
    A thread-local object is an object that is stored in a dedicated structure, attached to the current thread id. Flask utilizes thread local objects internally so that user don’t have to pass objects around from function to function within a request to stay threadsafe.  Besides, Thread local storage performs your logger’s context global but only within the current thread. This approach is helpful, but it needs a valid request context for dependency injection or when attempting to reuse code which utilizes a value pegged to the request.
20. Explain the syntax and how to use a Function as A Class?
    function functionName(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }
    // Creating an object
    var variable_name= new functionName(“Zuan”);
    console.log(variable_name.name); //Zuan
21. Explain what is lazy loading?
    Lazy loading is a design pattern generally utilized in computer programming to delay initialization of an object until the period at which it is required. It can contribute to performance in the program’s operation if correctly and properly utilized. Besides, it is a loading code only once the user needs it. For instance, there is a button on the page, which reveals a different layout once the user pressed it. Hence, there is no necessary to load code for that layout on initial page load.

    ◦ It makes even good JavaScript code more readable.
    • It makes everyday tasks easier to perform with CoffeeScript rather than JavaScript.
24. Explain what is Event Delegation?
    Event delegation points to the process of using event propagation to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. It enables you to avoid adding event listeners to particular nodes; instead, you can add a single event listener to a parent element.
25. How can you increase page performance?
    I can increase the page performance by the following methods.
    ◦ Clean up the HTML document.
    ◦ Reduce external HTTP requests.
    ◦ Sprites, compressed images, smaller images.
    ◦ Incorporate JavaScript at the bottom of the page.
    ◦ Minify CSS, JavaScript, HTML.
    • CDN and Caching.
26. What is Ajax?
    AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows applications to transport data to/from a server asynchronously without refreshing the page. This means that it is likely to update parts of a web page, without reloading the entire page. For instance, your new Gmail messages arrive and are marked as new even if you have not refreshed the web page.

27. What is the difference between Block, Inline,  Inline-block, and Box-sizing?
    ◦ Inline is the default. For example: An inline element is <span>.
    ◦ Block shows as a block element, such as <div> or <p>.
    ◦ Inline-block shows an element as an inline-level block container.
    • Box-sizing displays the browser sizing properties.
28. What is Event Bubbling?
    Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the deepest target element. It causes all events in the child nodes to be automatically passed to its parent nodes. The advantage of this method is speed because the code only requires to traverse the DOM tree once.
29. Explain what is a Closure?
    A closure is a sequence of a function bundled together with references to its enclosing state. It gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. When a function renders a function, that is when the concept of closures becomes more consistent. The rendered function has access to variables that are not in the global scope, but they individually exist in its closure.
30. Explain how do you deal with browser-specific style incompatibility?
    There are multiple ways to operate about this. According, the simple way to proceed would be to utilize a conditional statement in the head tag of your HTML. In this way, you can recognize the browser and load an external stylesheet.
